# **Codebasics Q\&A System**

**An End-to-End Google PaLM + LangChain Project for an E-Learning Platform**

This project builds a **fully functional AI-powered Question & Answer system** for an e-learning company called **Codebasics** (website: [codebasics.io](https://codebasics.io)). Codebasics specializes in data-related courses, bootcamps, and community learning. They have **thousands of active learners** who frequently seek help via email or their Discord server.

The goal is to **reduce the repetitive workload** on their human support staff by providing a **Streamlit-based AI assistant** that can instantly answer student queries from the company’s **real FAQ dataset**.

---

## **Key Features**

* **Real Industry Data** – Uses Codebasics’ actual FAQ CSV file, the same file their human staff uses for learner support.
* **End-to-End AI Workflow** – From data ingestion to embedding generation, vector storage, retrieval, and LLM-based answer generation.
* **User-Friendly UI** – Built with **Streamlit** for smooth, interactive question answering.
* **Scalable Knowledge Base** – Students can query the bot anytime, reducing manual intervention.
* **Fast and Relevant Responses** – Answers are returned in seconds with contextual accuracy.

If you’d like, I can also **redesign this into a visually rich README** with custom diagrams showing the pipeline flow from *student query → FAISS retrieval → Google PaLM answer*. That would make it look like a polished GitHub portfolio project.

Do you want me to create that visual workflow diagram next?
